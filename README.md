# RFM_modeling_-_KMeans_clustering_for_customer_segmentation
In this project, SQL queries were used to pull customer data from an SQLite database into Jupyter Notebook environment. Data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and feature engineering were performed to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms. Finally, KMeans clustering in Scikit-learn library was explored and used to profile customers to four groups; Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.
